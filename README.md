# Flic-Integration with the SMIP

This project enables the use of Flic Smart Buttons by the Swedish company [Shortcut Labs AB](https://flic.io/) with the [ThinkIQ](https://www.thinkiq.com) Industry 4.0 Manufacturing Platform. The platform is also know as the [Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform](https://www.cesmii.org/smip) (SMIP).

## What's in this Repo

This repository contains:
1) A SMIP library including a browser script that allows to configure smart buttons and map events to attributes in the model.
2) A JavaScript module for a Flic hub. The module utilizes the SMIP's GraphQL API for authorization and posting of Flic Smart Button click events.
3) A few [blog posts](./Integrating%20Flic%20Smart%20Buttons%20with%20the%20SMIP.md) about motivation and usage of this project.
